# Simplistic-Approach-to-Design-an-Affordable-Prototype-of-Object-Finding-Device
People with short-term memory or suffering from amnesia tend to forget the location of an object where they placed it. An object detecting device may be useful not only for these particular people but also for the elderly and children. Moreover, this type of device has extensive application in monitoring, tracking, and exploration purposes. Here, we have designed an affordable prototype of an object finding device which costs only 7.09 USD that can operate with up to 98.96 percent efficiency.
